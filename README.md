Bit Banger
==========

Bit Banger is a simple GUI written in [Tcl/Tk](http://www.tcl.tk/) to
aid the user in writing and/or deconding integer words needed to perform
[bit banging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_banging) bus control on
various platforms.

## Requirements

[Tcl/Tk version 8.5 or later](http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/).

## Usage

Simply write a number (either decimal or hexadecimal) in the appropriate
text entry and press the return key to toggle the state of the other
entry and the state of the 32 bits under the entries. Clicking on a bit
will toggle its state and change the content of the text entries
accordingly.

## Wishes

- <s>Add a canvas representing the waveforms generated by a group of words.</s>
